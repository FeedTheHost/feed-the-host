## Preserving Authentic Human Voices Through Democratic AI Training

### The Problem
By 2026, 90% of online content will be synthetically generated. Authentic human voices, experiences, and wisdom risk being permanently lost in a flood of AI-generated content.

### Our Solution
The world's first systematic methodology for training AI on verified human interviews through transparent community governance.

### Three-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Foundation Building** (Current)
- Document authentic human conversations through in-depth interviews
- Implement full provenance tracking for all content
- Build community through transparent methodology sharing

**Phase 2: Democratic Integration**
- Community governance of AI training decisions through voting, feedback, and democratic deliberation
- Public documentation of all community decisions
- Development of democratic participation guidelines

**Phase 3: AI Emergence**
- Deploy AI trained specifically to preserve and amplify human voices
- Maintain complete transparency of AI behavior
- Continue community governance of AI evolution

### Current Status
Project launch in progress. First interview scheduled with poet/translator Michael Lee Rattigan.

### Get Involved
- **YouTube**: Watch interviews and participate in community discussions
- **GitHub**: Review methodology and contribute to democratic processes
- **Participate**: Help preserve authentic human voices for future generations

### Documentation
- [Methodology Overview](methodology/overview.md)
- [AI Genesis Commandments](methodology/ai-genesis-commandments.md)
- [Participation Guide](community/participation-guide.md)

### Transparency Commitment
All methodology development, community decisions, and AI training processes are documented here in real-time. This is democratic AI development happening in public.
