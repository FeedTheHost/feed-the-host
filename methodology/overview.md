## Problem Statement
By 2026, 90% of online content will be synthetically generated (Forbes prediction). Authentic human voices, experiences, and wisdom risk being permanently lost in a flood of AI-generated content.

## Our Solution
Systematic methodology for preserving authentic human voices through democratic AI training.

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Current)
- Document authentic human conversations through in-depth interviews
- Implement full provenance tracking for all content
- Build community through transparent methodology sharing
- Establish interview pipeline with diverse, thoughtful humans

### Phase 2: Democratic Integration
- Community governance of AI training decisions
- Transparent voting, feedback, and democratic deliberation
- Public documentation of all community decisions
- Development of democratic participation guidelines

### Phase 3: AI Emergence
- Deploy AI trained specifically to preserve human voices
- Maintain complete transparency of AI behavior
- Continue community governance of AI evolution
- Document methodology for replication

## Current Status
Project launch in progress. First interview scheduled with poet/translator Michael Lee Rattigan.

## Participation
This is a public, transparent project. All methodology development, community decisions, and AI training processes will be documented here in real-time.
